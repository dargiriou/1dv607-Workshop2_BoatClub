# Grade 3 requirements

### Changes: 
Separated the one controller into four controllers more appropriate to their task. Moved the file manager class into 
the model. Added data validation in the model as well. Created a list for the IDs in order to have unique ones.

### New Implementations: 
Added the authentication requirement, now the users need to log in with their ID and a password in order to 
change data. A default admin username and password has been set in order to register and manipulate members. 
Username : admin Password: admin
Added the simple Search implementation; can now search for members through several different attributes.
